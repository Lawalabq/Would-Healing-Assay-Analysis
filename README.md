# 🧪 Wound Assay Analysis with Skimage

Welcome to my **Wound Assay Analysis** project! This project uses the power of **Skimage** for performing image-based wound healing assays, inspired by the paper _"An Introduction to the Wound Healing Assay Using Live Cell Microscopy"_ 📄.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Wound healing assays are an essential tool for studying cell migration 🦠. I utilized **Skimage** to process and analyze images from wound healing experiments, tracking the closing of wounds over time. Whether you're a scientist or just curious, this repository showcases how computer vision can reveal the incredible process of wound repair.

## 📚 What’s Inside?

- **Skimage for Image Analysis**: Leveraging this Python library to extract critical data from wound assay images, such as wound area and closure percentage.
- **Fun Yet Powerful**: Who said science can’t be fun? I've blended my love for image analysis with a dash of excitement to make this project both insightful and enjoyable. 💡🔬
